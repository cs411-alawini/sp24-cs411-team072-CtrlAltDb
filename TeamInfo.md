## Project Summary

UIUC Course Investigator is a project aimed at replicating or expanding what has been done by the [MCS website](https://uiucmcs.org/) for the entire university with potentially more functionality. This website contains extremely helpful information (user reviews, course ratings, difficulty ratings, semesters offered, and tools used) not found on the [grade disparity website](https://waf.cs.illinois.edu/discovery/grade_disparity_between_sections_at_uiuc/), but it is limited to the MCS courses. Our goal is to modify the [existing repository](https://github.com/uiuc-mcs/uiuc-mcs) to use a relational database instead of Firebase or start a project from scratch while potentially adding more functionality (professors who have recently taught the course and user ratings on them, summary of the course content from user reviews, average course GPA from previous few semesters, etc).
